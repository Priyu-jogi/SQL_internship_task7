# SQL Developer Internship – Task 7: Creating Views

This task was part of my SQL Developer Internship where I practiced creating and using **SQL Views** in my `library_management_system` database. Views help simplify complex queries and improve data abstraction.

---

## Objective
- Learn how to **create, use, and manage views** in MySQL.
- Understand the benefits of views for reusability, abstraction, and security.

---

## What I Did
1. Created **multiple views** for different use cases:
   - `IssuedBooksView` – Displays issued book details with reader and staff names.
   - `ReadersWithoutIssues` – Lists readers who have never issued a book.
   - `FictionBooks` – Shows only books from the Fiction category.
2. Used the views for **simplified queries**.
3. Practiced **updating data through views** where applicable.
4. Learned how to **drop views** when no longer needed.# SQL_internship_task7
